# Dockerized Storj Share Daemon
Dockerized Daemon + CLI for farming data on the [Storj](https://storj.io) network, suitable for standalone use or inclusion in other packages.

The founders of [Seedbloom](https://seedbloom.it) have been in support of [Storj](https://storj.io) from its inception and support the network by providing
[farmer](https://storj.io/faq.html#faq-3-2) nodes. This support is reciprocated by
the Storj network rewarding Seedbloom platform with [SJCX](https://storj.io/faq.html#faq-6-1), which contributes to our
operating costs.
